Alan B. Shepard, Jr. (1923-1998): Alan Shepard was the first American in space. He also walked on the moon.

On May 5, 1961, Shepard launched into space aboard the Freedom 7 capsule atop a Redstone rocket from Cape Canaveral. The flight lasted 15 1/2 minutes and did not orbit Earth; instead, Shepard flew 116 miles high and returned to Earth. His second flight was as commander of Apollo 14 in 1971, with Edgar Mitchell and Stuart Roosa. On the moon, Shepard and Mitchell collected more than 100 pounds of moon rocks, and Shepard became the first person to hit a golf ball on the moon.
